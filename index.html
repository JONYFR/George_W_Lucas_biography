    <p>American filmmaker George Lucas was responsible for the creation of a number of the most profitable movies in history, including the Star Wars and Indiana Jones trilogies. Lucas is also responsible for many technical innovations in filmmaking, especially
        special effects. Lucas was born in Modesto, California on May 14, 1944, the only son among George and Dorothy Lucas's four children. His father sold office supplies and equipment and owned a walnut farm. George Lucas Sr. found his son difficult
        to understand and quite stubborn. Lucas enjoyed racing cars and was the proud owner of a souped-up Fiat in high school. He was not a good student, and barely made passing grades. <br><br> <b><i>Shortly before  from high school, Lucas was involved
            in a serious car accident and nearly died from his injuries. With broken ribs, Lucas spent three months in the hospital. This experience seriously affected his outlook on life.</i></b> <br> <br> Lucas decided that he wanted to go to art school.
        His parents refused to support this decision, however, so Lucas instead studied social sciences at Modesto Junior College. While at Modesto, Lucas developed an interest in photography and film. He began making films with an 8mm camera, though
        he knew little about the art and its history. Lucas combined his new interest with an old one when he began to photograph car races. He also became involved in the building of race cars. One was built for Haskell Wexler, a famous cinematographer,
        who befriended Lucas. With the cinematographer's help, Lucas entered the film program at the University of Southern California <br> <br>(USC).Lucas had a variety of interests in film school. He began in animation, then moved on to cinematography
        and editing. Lucas was determined to succeed as a filmmaker, and produced eight student films. One of these films, 1965's THX-1138: 4EB won several awards, including a first prize at the National Student Festival. In this short film, Lucas explored
        his version of the future. Lucas graduated from USC in 1967 and worked on the fringes of the film industry for several years, holding odd jobs. He spent time as a cameraman for Saul Bass, filmed part of the infamous 1968 Rolling Stones concert
        in Altamonte, California, and worked as an editor for documentaries produced by the United States Information Agency. While working for the USIA he met <mark> Marcia Griffin</mark>,a film editor.<b>They married in 1969</b> , and adopted a child
        in 1981.
        <mark> The couple divorced in 1984 and Lucas later adopted two children on his own.</mark>

    <h2>George Lucas's Personal life:</h2>

    <p>
        Personal Life In addition to being a filmmaker, Lucas has been dedicated to helping improve education through the George Lucas Educational Foundation. Created in the early 1990s, the organization encourages the use of project-based and team-based learning,
        among other education reforms. The foundation's mission is deeply personal to Lucas, who spent many years as a single father to his adopted daughter Amanda after his divorce from film editor Marcia (Griffin) Lucas in 1983. Following their split,
        Lucas also adopted two more children, Katie and Jett. In January 2013, Lucas announced his engagement to Mellody Hobson, president of Ariel Investments. The couple had been dating for five years prior to their engagement. The 69-year-old Lucas
        and 44-year-old Hobson wed in late June 2013 at Skywalker Ranch in Marin County, California. Shortly afterward, they welcomed daughter Everest to the family. Fact Check We strive for accuracy and fairness. If you see something that doesn't look
